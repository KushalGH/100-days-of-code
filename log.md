### Day 1: August 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Excited!! Let's Start. Started with D3.JS

**Thoughts:** Visualization of Data in the form of charts and Maps. Worked on basic examples like Geometrical shapes, bar Charts, Multi Value maps. Facing issue in using selection-multi of D3. Will reesolve in an hour

### Day 2: August 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: D3.JS: Worked on Lines and upgraded from D3JS version 3 to version 5 

**Thoughts:** It's a big different in D3 version 3 and version 5. So, If anyone thinks to start, then please start with version 5 of D3JS
