### Day 1: August 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Excited!! Let's Start. Started with D3.JS

**Thoughts:** Visualization of Data in the form of charts and Maps. Worked on basic examples like Geometrical shapes, bar Charts, Multi Value maps. Facing issue in using selection-multi of D3. Will reesolve in an hour

**Link to work:** [D3JS Examples](https://github.com/KushalGH/d3_js_poc)

### Day 2: August 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: D3.JS: Worked on Lines and upgraded from D3JS version 3 to version 5 

**Thoughts:** It's a big different in D3 version 3 and version 5. So, If anyone thinks to start, then please start with version 5 of D3JS

### Day 3: August 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: BlockChain use case for Disaster Manegement

**Thoughts:** Whenever I try to understand new use case of BlockChain, I start loving BlockChain more.

### Day 4: August 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Environment Setup on fresh Ubuntu operating system for BlockChain. 

**Thoughts:** I was using Windows for BlockChain Development, but was facing some issues while installing GETH. So, moved to Ubuntu. This repository will help to setup ubuntu system for BlockChain Development.

### Day 5: August 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Time for SOLIDITY and Let's try OutputCache in C#

**Thoughts:** Re-Started with Solidity and tried OutputCache in C#

**Link to work:** [SOLIDITY](https://github.com/KushalGH/solidity)



### Day 6: August 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: NASA Space Hackathon: BlockChain use case for Disaster Manegement

**Thoughts:** Structured the Application for BlockChain Use for Disaster Management

### Day 9: September 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: SMART Contract that will allow the Autonomous Cars to pay their Tolls. 

**Thoughts:** Solidity is always amazing

**Link to work:** [Car Payments](https://github.com/KushalGH/car_payments_smart_contract)



### Day 10: September 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: RSA Algorithm 

**Thoughts:** RSA Cryptography Algorithm. A algorithm, with which you can encrypt by one key and can decrypt by another.

I came across very cool website that can solve mathematical problems online

wolframalpha.com

**Link to work:** [RSA Algorithm](https://github.com/KushalGH/Algorithms/tree/master/rsa_algorithm)


### Day 11: September 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: RSA Algorithm and Bitcoin Script

**Thoughts:** Solving RSA Algorithms and Bitcoin scripts was quite intersting.  

**Link to work:** [Algorithms](https://github.com/KushalGH/Algorithms/)




### Day 12: September 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Bitcoinscripts. Consensus in Bitcoin, Why and what!! 

**Thoughts:** Continued with #Bitcoinscripts. Consensus in Bitcoin: Why: "Ensure correct operations in the presence of faulty individuals" Properties: "Termination", "Validity", "Integrity", "Agreement" 

**Link to work:** [Algorithms](https://github.com/KushalGH/Algorithms/)


### Day 13-17: September 10 - September 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Build a basic DAPP and hosted on different environments: local, using Ganache, using TestRPC, Ropsten and Rinkeby

**Thoughts:** My main focus was to practice different deployment environments. Configurating new system for Ropsten is tough. Trying to build a proper doc which anyone can use to build the DAPP. Still struggling with some minor issue in Ropsten network, may figureout in few hours.

### Day 19: September 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: #bitcoin_verify_sign_txn

**Thoughts:** Loved signing and verifing the Txns
Sign Txn: 
PrivateKey + msg -> Signing Algo -> Signature

Verify Txn: 
wallet address + signature + msg -> Verification Algor -> true/false
